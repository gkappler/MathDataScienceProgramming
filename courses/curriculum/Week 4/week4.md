## Homework

(materials below)

1. Why is the colloquial term "relation" justified for the Cartesian product *A* x *B* of two sets *A* and *B*?

   In mathematics, a binary relation over sets X and Y is a subset of the Cartesian product X × Y; that is, it is a set of ordered pairs (x, y) consisting of elements x in X and y in Y. It encodes the common concept of relation: 
An element x is related to an element y, if and only if the pair (x, y) belongs to the set of ordered pairs that defines the binary relation. A binary relation is the most studied special case n = 2 of an n-ary relation over sets X1, ..., Xn, which is a subset of the Cartesian product X1 × ... × Xn. 


2. Why is a function a relation?  What special kind of relation is a function?
    A relation is a function when it maps each input to exactly one output. The set of all functions is a subset of the set of all relations. That means all functions are relations, but not all relations are functions. 
 

3. Do you agree with "[tertium non datur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle)"?
Tertium non Datur or Law of the excluded middle stipulate that any statement is either true or false except for contigent statements about the future. Even if there is a problem of future contigents or logical determinism, I am agree with the statement because there is no third solution (i-e) any statement is either true or false.    
4. Russel's paradox

   This paradox refuted the first formal set definition of [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege#Work_as_a_logician) (who was spiritually devasted by this).
   
   Why might Gottlob have been so upset about it?
Russell's paradox shows that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions
It was following his work The Foundations of Arithmetic, where he attempted to derive arithmetic from logic, that Russell sent him the paradox that bears his name. Nevertheless Frege did not intend to reduce mathematical reasoning to its only logical dimension. His ideography aimed to associate on the same page, and in an explicit way, the mathematical content (horizontal line of the page) and the logical structure (vertical line).

# Curriculum Course MDSP - Week 4

You already have had your first Heureka!
Maybe you were not aware...
Take the time to find the tiniest feeling of Heureka-joy by re-reading chapter 10 (Sets).
Make that joy big and strong.
It is earned.

When joy is leaving you:
Take time to think and mentally digest.
Accept frustration. 
Learning takes time.
Walking slow and steady is good.
Only not walking at all means never arriving.

Familiarize yourself! Read up on it and think until it is familiar. 
Learn by heart,
seriously, until you can explain it to your inner child.

You WILL memorize these increasingly over time 
because notation and proof are required to read any other material...



## Functions
Your first steps made you familiar with notation, proof, and sets.

Notation is how you write.
Proof is how you answer "why?", rigorously in notation.
Sets are a formal way to clarify "what?" is talked about.

To know "what" is talked about more clearly, it helps to think about some attributes of "it".
That idea is captured in precise terms as "function".
Read chapter 11 in <https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/Student-Summer-Education-Internships/Proof-and-Reasoning.pdf>.

   

## Proof by Contradiction

Read up and meditate on "[tertium non datur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle)"?

Read up and meditate on "[ex falso sequitur quodlibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion)" (from the false follows anything).

Read [Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox) again.
