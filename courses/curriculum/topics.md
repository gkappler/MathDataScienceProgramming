# Topics

## Mathematics:

Enables students to master the essential mathematical tools and concepts,
that are elemental for major mathematical specializations.

The curriculum familiarizes with

1.  *Category* Theory to understand elements and functions, and dimensions as cross products,
2.  *Logic* to understand formal mathematical notation, proofs, as well as natural numbers,
3.  *Calculus* to understand the intricacies of continuity,
4.  *Linear Algebra* to master the most simple kind of nontrivial relations.
5.  *Multivariate Calculus*
6.  *Differential Equations*

These concepts are used all over across mathematical research as well as industry.
With this solid foundation you can pursue more advanced topics,
in pure mathematics, as well as applications.
