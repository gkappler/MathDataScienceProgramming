# Curriculum Course MDSP - Week 2
Please read the [course overview](../)

## Essential mathematical notation and proofs ([video](https://odysee.com/@MathDataScienceProgramming:6/MSDP-Week2-01-Notation-and-Logic:b)):

A journey starts at the very beginning.
At the very beginning is notation and logic.

Candidates for curriculum materials:
-   <https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/Student-Summer-Education-Internships/Proof-and-Reasoning.pdf> (Understand chapter 1-4)
-   <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mathematical_Proof> (read and test your understanding above)
-   <http://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching/teach/proofs.pdf> (read and test your understanding above)
-   <https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~vddries/main.pdf> (read and test your understanding above)

Each course takes a full semester to teach.
You need not read these books in entirety.
You are supposed to read only the beginning as far as you get. 

Familiarize yourself with 
1. notation and 
2. the types of proof.

You will get a couple more similar course notations and logic. 

Accept frustration. 
Learning takes time.
Walking slow and steady is good.
Only not walking at all means never arriving.

Familiarize yourself! Read up on it and think until it is familiar. 
Learn this by heart. 
Seriously, until you can explain it to your inner child.

You WILL memorize these increasingly over time 
because notation and proof are required to read any other material...


## Essential programming tools: Version Control ([Video](https://odysee.com/@MathDataScienceProgramming:6/MSDP-Week1-05-GitHub-Guides-1440:e))
- Learn how to create a personal website: <https://guides.github.com/features/pages/>
- Read Chapter 1 in <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control>
- Learn the basics of github issues, so we can coordinate/discuss tasks at <https://github.com/gkappler/MathDataScienceProgramming/issues>.


## Homework ([Video](https://odysee.com/@MathDataScienceProgramming:6/MSDP-Week2-02-Homework:3))
1. Fork this repository and adapt to your personal website with
   https://github.com/gkappler/MathDataScienceProgramming
   
2. Edit in [index.md](../../../index.md) - as a first draft version
   1.  your public biography (About me) and
   2.  your course interests
    
3. What methods of proof are there? List all, and describe them in your own words, editing this file
   - Direct proof 
   - Counterexample pointing out a contradiction on an example.
   - Proof by all sub-cases (never forget any possible case, that might be harder than you think!)
   - ....
