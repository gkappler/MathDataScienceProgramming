## Homework

(materials below)

1. What are two "approaches" to probability?  Which one makes more sense to you, any why?
Answer: The two approaches are:  Frequentist probability and Subjective probability.
Frequentist probability or frequentism is an interpretation of probability; it defines an event's probability as the limit of its relative frequency in many trials. Probabilities can be found (in principle) by a repeatable objective process (and are thus ideally devoid of opinion).
Subjective probability is a type of probability derived from an individual's personal judgment or own experience about whether a specific outcome is likely to occur.
It contains no formal calculations and only reflects the subject's opinions and past experience rather than on data or computation.
Subjective probabilities differ from person to person and contain a high degree of personal bias.
Therefore, Frequentist probability make more sense to me because it follows an objective process not an invidual's personal judgment as the subjective probability. 


2. What are Kolmogorov's Axioms? Why are they assumed -- and not proven?
Answer: The three Kolmogorov's Axions are:
1)For any event A, P(A) ≥ 0. In English, that’s “For any event A, the probability of A is greater or equal to 0”.
2)When S is the sample space of an experiment; i.e., the set of all possible outcomes, P(S) = 1. In English, that’s “The probability of any of the outcomes happening is one hundred percent”, or—paraphrasing— “anytime this experiment is performed, something happens”.
3)If A and B are mutually exclusive outcomes, P(A ∪ B ) = P(A) + P(B).
Here ∪ stands for ‘union’. We can read this by saying “If A and B are mutually exclusive outcomes, the probability of either A or B happening is the probability of A happening plus the probability of B happening”. 

These three axioms don’t:
1. Tell us where and when to apply the rules,
2. Give us guidelines or procedures for calculating probabilities,
3. Any insights to the nature of random processes.

# Curriculum Course MDSP - Week 6

You have seen that mathematics is symbolic construction of proof to find truth given assumtions.
You have been introduced to foundational mathematics of sets and functions.

You also have been introduced to another idea, the technical construction: programming computations in the julia language.

This week you get a glimpse of how difficult it is to use these precise concepts to measure reality, the unknown, the observation of creation. 
How can we create a model of the natural observable world?
What is that, a "model"?
What is uncertainty anyway?
Can we grasp the unprecise precisely?

This week aims at opening a door to data science from a theoretical perspective.
Probability is a difficult and advanced topic -- you will most likely not understand everything.

So, please do not expect "heureka" this week.
Be content with accepting surprise and try to see problems that are not obvious.

Meditate on what you expect from experiments and observations "science", and be puzzled by serious paradoxical issues, which seem not to exist for the ignorant:
Accept that volumes are not as simple as it intuitively seems, and why the Kolmogorov axioms insist that volumes in observation for science are behaving intuitively.

## Basics of Data Science

1. Watch [Probability Primer by mathematical monk](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL17567A1A3F5DB5E4) -- optional: Watch [The Banach–Tarski Paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86-Z-CbaHA).
2. Read Preface and Chapter 1 in [Probability Theory: The Logic of Science](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf) -- optional: read chapter 2
3. Read [Kolmogorov's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms).
4. Read [Frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) and [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) interpretation of probability.
