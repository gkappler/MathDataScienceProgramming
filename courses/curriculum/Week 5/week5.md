# Curriculum Course MDSP - Week 5

You have seen that mathematics is more about symbols and construction of ideas than about numbers.
Your first steps made you familiar with notation, proof, sets, and functions.

Do you know what "time" is?
Like "time", these mathematical ideas seem so simple and at the same time so complicated.
No worries, you will meet these ideas time and again!
Why?
Because these ideas go all the way when understanding mathematics.

Having understood these fundamentals, you are now ready for the first step understanding an application of these ideas: programming in the julia language.

### Note:
To master programming, you will need to practice coding, writing programs, running programs.
Thus it will be best to organize a computer to learn the programming language julia.


## Basics of programming

1. Read chapter 1-3 in https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html,
2. memorize https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#_glossary
3. Read [unit testing](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#_unit_testing)
3. voluntary: read [what exactly is the semantic difference between set and type](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/91330/what-exactly-is-the-semantic-difference-between-set-and-type/91345?noredirect=1#comment197425_91345)

Think about these analogies between mathematical and programming terms:

- Syntax is how you write, similar to logical notation.
- There are proofs in theoretical computer science.
  In practice, programming invites a lot of "trial-and-error":
  The computer offers you to "run what you wrote", so you can test if you get what you intended.
  Logical construction is a rigorous way to determine whether a conjecture is true/false -- if someone finds a proof.
  Program construction is a faster way to make something work -- most of the time at the cost of bugs.
- Julia types are a formal way to clarify "what?" is talked about, similar to sets.
- Julia functions can transform arguments to some computation result, similar to a mathematical function from the Cartesian product of function arguments to the return type.
