## Homework

(materials below)

1. What makes a statement a logical expression?
A logical statement is a declarative sentence which conveys factual information. If the information is correct then we say the statement is true; and if the information is incorrect, then we say the statement is false. All logical statements are formed by combining simple statements.

2. What is the difference between `a=b` and `a==b`    
The difference is :
(a=b) is Assignment operator.
(a==b) is Relational operator.
1)a=b
Let's go with example. b=1 and if you are writing a=b then a=1.
It means what ever value in b will be copied to a.
2) a==b
This is related to logical comparisons. let us take an Example if a=2 and b=2 then a==b is a TRUE or YES or CORRECT.

3. What are variables, what are arguments, what is similar?
Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. On the other hand, arguments are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes. The similarity is variables are elements in arguments.

# Curriculum Course MDSP - Week 6

You have seen that mathematics is more about symbols and construction of ideas than about numbers.
Your first steps made you familiar with notation, proof, sets, and functions.
And made the first step understanding an application of these ideas: programming in the julia language.
This week you learn more concepts in programming: 
- Conditionals
- more about functions returning results, and function composition
- iteration

### Note:
To master programming, you will need to practice coding, writing programs, running programs.
Thus it will be best to organize a computer to learn the programming language julia.


## Basics of programming

1. Read chapter 5-7 in [Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (Ben Lauwens)](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html),
2. memorize chapter Glossaries
3. voluntary: If you want to get an idea what relates proof to computation and why there provably exist true statements that are not provable, watch [GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem - Numberphile](https://youtu.be/O4ndIDcDSGc).
